## Example of keycodes for ZMK remap
The default firmware does not support mousekeys. However, the encoders on both sides are working as written and prepared by author snstein. For additional features, please refer to the ZMK website. If you have any questions, you can ask in their Discord server. The following are some basic and essential keycodes:


### Single tap
Always remember their prefix `&kp` or `&trans` or `to` etc. Refer to [Keyboard Codes of ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/codes).

### Hold
The most basic `&lt 5 Z` means hold to access layer 5, tap as z; while `&mt LSHIFT TAB` means hold as modifier Left Shift, tap as Tab.


### Macro
You can copy the following and edit according to your needs. Just need to note that for Left Shift+X it is `&macro_press &kp LSHFT &macro_tap &kp X &macro_release &kp LSHFT`; while single key tap for example c8 is `&macro_tap &kp C &kp N8`. In key remap, use `&gmail` to register macro.

```
/ {
    macros {
		gmail: gmail {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-macro";
        label = "ZM_gmail";
        #binding-cells = <0>;
        wait-ms = <10>;
        tap-ms = <10>;
        bindings = <&macro_tap &kp X &kp C &kp H &kp C &kp L &kp O &kp W &kp AT_SIGN &kp G &kp M &kp A &kp I &kp L &kp PERIOD &kp C &kp O &kp M>;
        };

    };
};
```

## Flashing u2f to split
1. Connect left and right splits to your pc (both connect together using type c cable)
2. Put right into bootloader mode (press the reset button), one window is popped out showing "nicenano" folder. Dont do anything yet, remember this folder as right split. 
3. Now press reset button on your left split, one window will be popped out as previous step.
4. Drag left and right u2f to respective folders.
5. Do not disconnect right split yet. 
6. Remove left split from type c cable. Proceed to `First time bluetooth connection` to connect your board to pc. If successfully connected, you shall able to type without cable now. 
8. If so, remove the right split from type c cable. Both should be working good now!
